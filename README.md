# PAN-demic
PAN-demic is a recipe api designed to get you cooking in these unprecedented times.

## description
PAN-demic was designed as a 'really simple' crud api. routes exist to create new recipes, as well as read (all and by id) and update existing recipes. the simplicity of this project is reflective of the relative earliness in the vmware ascent program when it was completed. notably, PAN-demic does not use a true database; its data is stored in-memory. this is a point of improvement (see [excruciatingly-simple-automobiles](https://github.com/rosemaling/excruciatingly-simple-automobiles) for an implementation of a crud api with database mapping). additionally, the delete route wasn't finished (this was a time issue, not a comprehension issue!). 

overall, PAN-demic served as an introduction to api development in spring, and its creation laid the groundwork for more complex projects (such as la p√¢tisserie and excruciatingly-simple-automobiles).
